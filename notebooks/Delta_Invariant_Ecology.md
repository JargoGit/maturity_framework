# Delta Invariant — Ecology (Zero-Lag Domain)

## Core Claim
Ecological systems expose **Delta** with effectively **zero lag** because their primary viability proxy—**usable energy availability per unit time**—has a **non-negotiable minimum**.

When this minimum rises beyond recoverability, collapse occurs immediately.  
There is no disguise phase, no volatility buffer, and no narrative delay.

## Primary Ecological Proxy (Canonical)

### Net Usable Energy Availability  
Commonly operationalized as:
- Net Primary Productivity (NPP)
- Energy flux per trophic level
- Calories available per organism / per area / per season

This proxy is foundational because:
- It has a **hard floor** (below which life cannot persist)
- It cannot be borrowed, leveraged, or deferred
- It cannot be smoothed, averaged, or politically stabilized
- Recovery is binary: **energy returns in time, or extinction follows**

This makes it the cleanest expression of Delta.

## Supporting Hard-Minimum Proxies (Downstream)

These proxies also exhibit non-negotiable minima, but typically fail **after** energy balance breaks:

- Freshwater availability (per basin / per organism)
- Oxygen concentration (especially aquatic systems)
- Soil fertility / topsoil depth
- Temperature tolerance thresholds (enzymatic failure points)

All are constrained by energy flow and metabolic cost.

## Structural Difference vs Human Systems

| Domain        | Primary Proxy Type        | Lag Length |
|--------------|---------------------------|------------|
| Poker        | Decision load / slack     | Near-zero  |
| Finance      | Credit stress             | Short      |
| Institutions | Wages / productivity      | Long       |
| **Ecology**  | **Usable energy**         | **Zero**   |

Human systems delay collapse by:
- buffering medians
- suppressing minima
- borrowing time through leverage and narrative

Ecological systems cannot.

## Delta Signature in Ecology

Delta is detected when:
- The **minimum viable energy state rises**
- The system **does not return to prior floors**
- Adaptation fails to restore slack
- Collapse follows without volatility spikes

There is no warning phase distinct from failure.

---

## Key Insight

**Ecology does not “listen better” than humans.  
It simply has no signal delay.**

Collapse appears sudden only because humans are accustomed to lagged proxies.

---

## Implication for the Framework

Ecology represents the **zero-lag boundary case** of the Delta invariant.

If Delta holds here—as it does—then:
- Lag length is a property of the proxy, not the invariant
- Delta generalizes across domains without changing logic
- Early warning exists everywhere; only visibility differs

## Carry-Forward Sentence (Canonical)

> *Systems collapse not when volatility rises, but when their minimum viable state permanently rises and never comes back.*

In ecology, this happens immediately.
