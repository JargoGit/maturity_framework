# Delta Invariant — v1.0

## Purpose
Define a portable, cross-domain early-warning invariant for system failure that detects **loss of recoverability** before volatility, collapse, or visible crisis.

This framework does **not** predict events.
It detects when recovery becomes structurally impossible.

---

## Core Definition (Delta)

**Delta** is the moment when a system’s **minimum viable state permanently rises** and does not return.

Formally:
> A system enters Delta when its rolling minimum exceeds its historical floor and fails to relax back within a recovery window.

Delta is **not** collapse.
Delta is the loss of slack that makes collapse inevitable under continued strain.

---

## Ordering of Failure (Invariant)

Across domains, failure follows the same order:

1. **Strain**  
   Rising minimum load / stress  
   (loss of slack)

2. **Drift**  
   Median effort rises to match strain  
   (normalization of stress)

3. **Disguise**  
   Variance remains flat or controlled  
   (false sense of stability)

4. **Concentration**  
   Outcomes become larger, rarer, leveraged  
   (forced recovery paths)

5. **Cliff**  
   Collapse, crisis, or visible failure  
   (often blamed on volatility)

Delta occurs at **Step 1**, not Step 5.

## What Delta Is NOT

- ❌ Not volatility
- ❌ Not averages
- ❌ Not outcomes
- ❌ Not sentiment
- ❌ Not prediction

Delta lives in the **floor**, not the mean.

## Empirical Validations (Completed)

### Poker (Fast-Lag System)
- Proxy: per-hand load (line count)
- Finding:
  - Minimum load rises first
  - Variance remains flat
  - Outcomes degrade later
- Result: Delta detected minutes before bankroll damage

### Finance (Medium-Lag System)
- Proxy: BAA credit spreads
- Finding:
  - Rolling minimum stress rises early
  - Median follows
  - Crisis arrives later
- Result: Delta detected years before financial collapse

### USSR (Long-Lag System)
- Proxy: productivity vs wages
- Finding:
  - Productivity floor erodes
  - Wages buffered artificially
  - Collapse delayed but inevitable
- Result: Delta detected decades before collapse

**Conclusion:**  
Delta is invariant.  
Lag length depends on the proxy, not the mechanism.

---

## Lag Principle

> **Lag length is determined by how directly the proxy reflects recoverability.**

- Market proxies → short lag  
- Human livelihood proxies → long lag  
- Ecological proxies → near-zero lag  

Delta does not change.  
Only the clock does.

---

## Why Ecology Matters Next

Ecology removes:
- leverage
- narrative buffering
- institutional delay
- symbolic accounting

Ecological systems obey physical minima.

This makes them the **hardest possible test** of Delta.

---

## Selected Ecological Test Case

**Coral Reefs (Thermal Stress / Bleaching)**

Why coral:
- Non-negotiable physiological thresholds
- Near-zero lag between strain and signal
- Measurable recovery windows
- Direct human interaction (temperature, runoff, acidification)
- No abstraction layer

Coral cannot borrow time.

---

## Test Structure (Planned)

We will apply the **same logic**, unchanged:

1. Identify rolling minimum stress
2. Detect permanent floor lift (Delta)
3. Observe median drift
4. Ignore volatility unless it appears naturally
5. Confirm persistence vs recovery

If coral fails this test, the framework fails.

---

## Ethical Posture

This framework is:
- Diagnostic, not prescriptive
- Preventive, not punitive
- Informational, not ideological

It provides **outs**, not ultimatums.

---

## Canonical Sentence

> *Systems do not collapse when they become volatile.  
They collapse when their minimum viable state rises and never comes back.*

## Status

- Version: 1.0
- Domain coverage: Poker, Finance, Historical Institutions
- Next domain: Ecology (Coral)
- Confidence level: High
