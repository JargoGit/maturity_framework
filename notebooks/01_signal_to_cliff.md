# Signal → Drift → Disguise → Cliff

## Definitions
- Strain:
- Drift:
- Disguise:
- Cliff:

## Empirical Evidence (Poker Case)
- Rising minimum load:
- Rising median load:
- Flat variance:
- Outcome concentration:

## Key Insight
-Strain removes slack (min rises), drift normalizes effort (median rises), 
 disguise suppresses alarms (variance stays flat), and collapse appears only 
 when outcomes concentrate.
 
 ## Concept Mapping
 
 1.Rising minimum load = strain (STRUCTURAL)
   The system loses its low cost states There is 
   no “easy recovery” left this is structural, not behavioral this is the first
   invariant break.

 2.Rising median load = drift (ADAPTIVE)
   The actor adapts to strain by normalizing higher effort Behavior shifts 
   without awareness Performance appears stable Drift is adaptation to strain 
   without recognition of lost slack.

 3.Flat variance = disguise (FALSE SAFTEY/STORED INSTABILITY)
   No volatility spike, no chaos, nothing triggers alarms, flat variance despite
   rising min + median load signals false stability. This is the red flag
   most systems miss.
 
 4.Outcome concentration = cliff (FORCED RELEASE UNDER LEVERAGE)
   Fewer recoverable paths, larger, more leveraged outcomes when recovery 
   occurs, failure probability rises sharply after this point. This is the 
   tipping point, not the warning.
