# Maturity Framework — Project Scope

## Purpose
This project formalizes a systems-level framework for understanding
maturity, harmony, conflict, and parasitic behavior across domains
(biology, psychology, ecology, economics, and social systems).

The goal is not prediction for control, but clarity for alignment.

## Guiding Principles
- Kindness as a system stabilizer
- Conditional boundaries as harm prevention
- Maturity as a measurable equilibrium state
- Conflict as a signal, not a failure
- Ethics as a structural property, not a belief

## What This Project Is
- Analytical
- Cross-disciplinary
- Evidence-seeking
- Visualization-driven
- Open to revision

## What This Project Is Not
- Ideological
- Political advocacy
- Deterministic psychology
- Spiritual doctrine
- A finished theory

## Status
Active development — structure first, proof second.

# Project Scope

This project formalizes a framework for understanding maturity, harmony, conflict,
and sustainability across biological, social, and systemic domains.

The goal is not prediction, optimization, or control.

The goal is clarity:
- to distinguish mature systems from extractive ones
- to identify conditions that support harmony
- to define boundaries where intervention becomes ethical
