# Delta: Loss of Recoverability Before Collapse

## Definition
Delta is the structural state where a system loses recoverability **before**
it exhibits volatility, chaos, or overt failure.

## Observable Signature
Delta is detected when the following pattern appears simultaneously:

1. Rising minimum load (strain floor increases)
2. Rising median load (adaptive drift)
3. Flat or suppressed variance (false stability)
4. Outcome concentration (recovery collapses into fewer, riskier paths)

## Order of Failure
The critical ordering is:

Load ↑ → Slack ↓ → Outcomes distort → Collapse

Volatility is **not** the early warning.

## Why This Matters
Systems typically fail because decision-makers wait for:
- volatility spikes
- visible chaos
- headline events

Delta occurs **earlier**, while control still appears intact.

## Empirical Validation (Poker Case)
- Load increased without variance expansion
- Outcomes lagged load compression
- Recovery became concentrated before failure

This demonstrates that:
> Loss of recoverability precedes instability.

## Scope
Delta is diagnostic, not predictive.
It identifies when intervention still works.
