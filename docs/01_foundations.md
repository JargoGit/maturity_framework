# Foundations

This framework begins with a simple observation:

Systems that endure share common traits.
Systems that collapse also share common traits.

Endurance is not optimization.
Harmony is not equilibrium.
Stability is not rigidity.

Maturity is the capacity of a system to remain coherent
while adapting to pressure without externalizing harm.
