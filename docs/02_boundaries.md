# Boundaries & Non-Goals

This document defines what the Maturity Framework is **not**, and what it explicitly refuses to do.

These boundaries exist to preserve ethical integrity, prevent misuse, and maintain long-term system health.

---

## 1. No Deterministic Judgment of Individuals

This framework does **not** label, rank, diagnose, or assign moral scores to individual people.

- No “good vs bad” classifications  
- No prediction of individual intent  
- No weaponized profiling  

The framework evaluates **patterns, systems, and incentives**, not identities.

---

## 2. No Coercive or Punitive Use

The framework is not designed to justify punishment, exclusion, surveillance, or control.

It may reveal risk patterns or unhealthy dynamics, but it does not prescribe force-based interventions.

Insight ≠ authority  
Understanding ≠ permission to dominate

---

## 3. No Replacement for Human Judgment

This framework supports human reasoning — it does not replace it.

Any quantitative signals must remain:
- contextual
- interpretable
- challengeable

Human agency and moral responsibility remain central.

---

## 4. No Optimization for Extraction

The framework does not optimize for:
- profit maximization at the expense of system health
- efficiency that degrades dignity
- growth without maturity

If a system “performs well” while degrading trust, meaning, or resilience, that is treated as failure.

---

## 5. No Claim of Totality or Final Truth

This framework is:
- provisional
- revisable
- open to falsification

It is a **lens**, not a law of nature.

---

## 6. Scope of Valid Use

Appropriate domains include:
- system health analysis
- sustainability assessment
- organizational dynamics
- social-ecological balance
- long-term resilience modeling

Inappropriate domains include:
- authoritarian governance
- ideological enforcement
- predictive policing
- social credit systems

---

## Closing Principle

The purpose of this framework is not control.

It exists to:
- increase legibility
- reduce harm
- preserve harmony
- support mature systems over time

Any application that violates these goals is out of scope by definition.
